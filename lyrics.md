# take over the wall by PJ Masks 

I'm Romeo
I am a genius
The greatest mind you've ever seen (Romeo-eo-eo)
I'm Romeo
A great inventor who made
A lot of really cool machines
(Oh, Romeo, oh, Romeo)
With my robot, I've got a master plan
To defeat the PJ pests in any way I can
Hey, I'm Romeo
I'm gonna take over the world
And don't you know
No one is ever gonna
Stop me from taking over the world
I'm Romeo
I'm really clever
I think I know most everything (Romeo-eo-eo)
I'm Romeo
You can't defeat me
I'll rule the world just like a king
With my robot, I've got a master plan
Defeat the PJ pests
'Cause I know I can
Hey, I'm Romeo
I'm gonna take over the world
And don't you know
No one is ever gonna
Stop me from taking over the world
